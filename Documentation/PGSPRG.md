### PGSPRG submission contest
The winning submission will be awarded Citation No. **00** and propagated throughout all contributions, along with the other zero citations. In order of the base value attached:  
- Citation **0** Reserved  
- Citation **00** Contest winner  
- Citation **000** cdsAsync  

## Entry Part 1
Complete the [License Builder Skill Script](../Skill/Open/buildLicense.il) and make the necessary "logical" alterations to the library. In other words, extracting and parsing a note made in each drawing is highly suboptimal. Please use an alternate method of citation and extraction. Be **creative** & *logical*.  

## Main Entry
While the tool you develop will be highly useful, it serves as an entry point for something larger, as Part 1 is fairly straightforward given a basic understanding of SKILL and the IC toolsuite.  

The following is a series of fictional scenarios used to illustrate an idea, and bring a series of questions to light.
