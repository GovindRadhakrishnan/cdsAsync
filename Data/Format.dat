Data Format for Cells:
Col 1 = Vdd [mV]
Col 2 = Temp [C]
Col 3 = Leakage [nA]
Col 4 = Forward Latency Up [ns]
Col 5 = Forward Latency Down [ns]
Col 6 = Backward latency Up [ns]
Col 7 = Backward Latency Down [ns]
Col 8 = Cycle Time (measured at dynamic slack) [ns]
Col 9 = Energy per Cycle [fJ]

TODO:
Col 10 = Probability of Timing Failure (violation of isochronic-fork)

Data Format for SRAM:
Col 1  = Vdd [mV]
Col 2  = Temp [C]
Col 3  = Leakage [nA]
Col 4  = Read Forward Latency [ns]
Col 5  = Write Forward Latency [ns]
Col 6  = Read Cycle Time [ns]
Col 7  = Write Cycle Time [ns]
Col 8  = Read Cycle Energy [fJ]
Col 9  = Write Cycle Energy (worse case, all bits flip) [fJ]

TODO:
Col 10 = Bit Error Rate
